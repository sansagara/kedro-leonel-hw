## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.14.0` by running:

```
kedro new
```

Take a look at the [documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:
 * Please don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file provided
 * Make sure your results can be reproduced by adding necessary data to `data/01_raw` only
 * Don't commit any data to your repository
 * Don't commit any credentials or local configuration to your repository
 * Keep all credentials or local configuration in `conf/local/`

## Installing dependencies

Dependencies should be declared in `src/requirements.txt`.

To install them, run:

```
kedro install
```

## Running Kedro

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## Testing Kedro

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests with the following command:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, please have a look at the file `.coveragerc`.


### Working with Kedro from notebooks

In order to use notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
   pip install jupyter
```

For using Jupyter Lab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

You can also start Jupyter Lab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

Running Jupyter or IPython this way provides the following variables in
scope: `proj_dir`, `proj_name`, `conf`, `io`, `parameters` and `startup_error`.

#### Ignoring notebook output cells in `git`

In order to automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can run `kedro activate-nbstripout`. This will add a hook in `.git/config` which will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be left intact locally.

## Package the project

In order to package the project's Python code in `.egg` and / or a `.wheel` file, you can run:

```
kedro package
```

After running that, you can find the two packages in `src/dist/`.

## Building API documentation

To build API docs for your code using Sphinx, run:

```
kedro build-docs
```

See your documentation by opening `docs/build/html/index.html`.
